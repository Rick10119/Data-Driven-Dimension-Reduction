% This code segment pertains to the setting of parameters and the definition of variables for the RTN model. It includes setting various parameters and variables within the model, as well as defining resource consumption and task start times.
% 
% In this code snippet, the parameters of the RTN model are first set, including the time interval, the number of hours data is used for, and the price. The original parameters are then loaded, and based on these parameters, information such as the number of tasks and resources is set. Subsequently, the resource consumption change matrix Î¼ is defined, representing the consumption and restoration of resources during task execution.
% 
% Finally, variables within the model are defined. Among them, RT represents the values of resources at different time points, and NIT indicates whether task i starts execution at time point t.
% 
% This code segment lays the foundation for modeling the RTN model, defining the necessary parameters and variables within the model, and providing a basis for subsequent model solving and optimization.

% We use 31 hours of data instead of 24 hours because production in an iron plant is uninterrupted,
% and follows a specific sequence. For example, after task 1 is completed, task 2 may take 4 hours to complete the batch.
% Therefore, to complete production tasks within 24 hours, task 1 needs to be completed by 19:00, which would prevent nighttime production.
% In reality, production in an iron plant spans across days, so task 1 should be allowed to run at hour 24. A method that minimally changes the code framework
% is to extend the day to 31 hours, and then consider production from hours 25-31 as part of hours 1-6. This is the approach we have adopted.
